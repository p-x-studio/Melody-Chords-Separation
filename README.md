# Melody Chords Separation From MusicXML
 
This repo implements a converter from MusicXML to Midi which separates melody and chords in two different tracks.
This is really useful to create a dataset to train a model able to generate melody conditioned to chords, or vice versa.

## How to run

- Set folder paths inside ```batch_convert.py```
- Run ```batch_convert.py```
